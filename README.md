# simple-poker-simulator

The poker simulator I am going to develop is going to simulate a poker with 2 players, one of which is a bot. So, the objective of the work is to develop a bot with a human level performance. The reason I have chosen this app is because of my bachelor thesis "Applications of artificial intelligence techniques in a poker game".
I am going to develop this project as a web application, so the bot would be written on JavaScript and designing in CSS and html. The frameworks and sources are not identified yet.
